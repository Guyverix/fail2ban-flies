It is important to note that there is the possibility of causing 
a storm from all the hosts forwarding the new ban to other hosts
We in general NEVER want this to happen.

The way to do this is to make sure whatever jail is used does
not have the script defined in its action.  We want to use a jail
that is not part of the default flow.

jail.local example listed uses its own action to make sure
that this new jail will not rebroadcast when it receives 
a ban against an IP address
