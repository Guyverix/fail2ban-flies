Investigating a dumb webserver with auth as an alternate to ssh

Python webserver from:
https://gist.github.com/fxsjy/5465353

This is a python2 gist

This is python3 with SSL support
https://github.com/tianhuil/SimpleHTTPAuthServer

spitball logic:
http port 19999 default
curl to server with GET opts in URL and auth in URL
KISS!  Dont bother with post.  No real point.

Internal to python call an os exec and just like the ssh version
run the fail2ban-client and ban/unban the IP address from the jail


Notes:
Daemon should run as root so no sudo needed for exec command
systemd control, and only inside systemd will the U/P reside, so only sudoers
would see it anyway.  Only a single login is actually needed for this

With a U/P basic security is addressed
SSL opton to encrypt..  Deends on if this can be automated at install time...

It would be nice to make this a more professional application
